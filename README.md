Synthesizer
===========

About
-----------------------
Using the Web Audio API, Canvas, and later the Web MIDI API, I'm building a simple synthesizer.  The keys are constructors, instances created dynamically and pushed into an array.  I've used the Railsback Curve function to create frequencies of those of an 88-key piano.  

At completion, the user will be able to:
* change the wave type,
* play keys in polyphony,
* adjust the gain,
* and apply delay.

Use
-----------
While remarkably ugly, you may still play this synthesizer!

In order to play around with the synthesizer:
1. Download the zip repository and unpack,
2. Crank up your favorite NodeJS server (I use IndexZero's "http-server"),
3. Navigate to appropriate address/port (pref. in Chrome; been having issues in Firefox),
4. Use the 'z, s, x, d, c, v, g, b, h, n, j, m ,[,]' keys on your desktop/laptop keyboard.
5. Click the little circular "mossy" object to change synth wave-types (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth).

Enjoy!

Thanks for taking the time to visit my Github account and play with one of my apps.
