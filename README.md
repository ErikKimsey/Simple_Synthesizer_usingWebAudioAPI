Synthesizer
===========

About
-----------------------
Using the Web Audio API, Canvas, and later the Web MIDI API, I'm building a simple synthesizer.  The keys are constructors, instances created dynamically and pushed into an array.  I've used the Railsback Curve function to create frequencies of those of an 88-key piano.  

At completion, the user will be able to:
* change the wave type,
* play keys in polyphony,
* adjust the gain,
* and apply delay.

Use
-----------
While remarkably ugly, you may still play this synthesizer!

In order to play around with the synthesizer:
1. Download this repository,
2. Open the 'index.html' file in Chrome or Firefox,
3. Use the 'z, s, x, d, c, v, g, b, h, n, j, m ,[,]' keys on your desktop/laptop keyboard.
4. Click the little circular "mossy" object to change synth wave-types (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth).

Enjoy!

Notes
----------
This project is in its very infancy, 2 days old as of May 18, 2016.  That being said, at the moment, the application can be played using keyboard keys, beginning with "z". In the following days, I will be further consolidating majority of code into a single file. Beyond that, a chic UI is being designed and will be applied -as it stands, the UI is neither chic nor "designed".
